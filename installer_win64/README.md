This directory contains the exetutable files necessary to run PAPARA(ZZ)I on a Windows 64-bit operating system. If MATLAB 2015b is not already installed on the computer, the PAPARA(ZZ)I installer will automatically offer the option to install the MATLAB Runtime.

- papara(zz)i_web.exe: this package file installs PAPARA(ZZ)I and downloads the MATLAB Runtime from the Internet (if not already installed).

- papara(zz)i_mcr.exe: this package file includes both PAPARA(ZZ)I and the MATLAB Runtime (use this option if an Internet connection is not available).
