# PAPARA(ZZ)I Test Dataset

The archive file contains a set of example images to test the PAPARA(ZZ)I program.

All images have been annotated with the following username: 'test-user'. To see the existing annotations, start PAPARA(ZZ)I, type 'test-user' (without quotation marks) when prompted for a username, and then select the folder containing the images. The existing annotations will be automatically read by PAPARA(ZZ)I.

To create new annotations, restart PAPARA(ZZ)I and choose a different username. Annotations made with a different username does not alter the annotations made by the other users.

To visualise the exported results, open the summary files (in the 'summary' subfolder) with Excel or any similar program (summary files are best displayed in a spreadsheet program).
